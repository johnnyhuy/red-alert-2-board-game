## How it works

The project is a 2D board game using different shapes from standard squares on the board.

We have units that can move depending on their unit behaviour by clicking and moving units on the board. This is similar to a traditional chess game but with a few twists!

## Development Environment

In order to run this we need to match these requirements:

- Any OS
